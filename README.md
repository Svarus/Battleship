# Battleship
Task to develop a section of code
 
 Please notice! For now while changing maxShipSize be sure also to change  size of game field (rows or/and columns).
 If game field is too small  program will enter to infinity loop trying to create ships without free space.
 By default Ship displays by "S" sign @see Cell#info to operate
